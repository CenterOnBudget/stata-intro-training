# Working directories

Almost every Stata script begins with setting the `r colorize("working directory", "YellowGreen")`. The working directory is the place where Stata will look for any files you reference later in the script. You set your working directory with the command `cd`.

```{stata eval=FALSE, echo = c(6)}
/* 
* Introduction to Stata

* Uncomment the line below and define your working folder

cd "C:/Users/my_username/Documents/project_folder/"
*/
```

Stata’s `cd` command understands `r colorize("~", "YellowGreen")` as an abbreviation for the home directory, so you can use this shortcut instead.
```{stata, eval=FALSE, collectcode=FALSE, echo=c(2)}
/*
cd "~/Documents/project_folder/"
*/
```

To see your working directory, type:

```{stata echo=TRUE, results="hide"}
pwd
```
There are two advantages of using working directories:

1. Once you set it, you won't need to write out the full file path of any file inside the working directory.
   + Without setting the working directory:
     
     > ```{stata, echo = c(2:4), eval=FALSE, collectcode=FALSE}
/*
use "C:/Users/my_username/Documents/project_folder/data-raw/my_data.dta"
* a bunch of code here *
save "C:/Users/my_username/Documents/project_folder/data/my_final_data.dta"
*/
      ```
    
    + With setting the working directory:
     
      > ```{stata, echo = c(2:5), eval=FALSE, collectcode=FALSE}
/*
cd "C:/Users/my_username/Documents/project_folder/"
use "data-raw/my_data.dta"
* a bunch of code here *
save "data/my_final_data.dta"
*/
         ```

2. If you move your project files from one folder to another, or rename the folder, you only need to change one line of code.
   + For instance, if you renamed `r colorize("project_folder", "LightCoral")` to `r colorize("new_project_folder", "YellowGreen")`, you'd simply change the `cd` command and the rest of your code would still work fine. :
   
      > ```{stata, echo = c(2), eval=FALSE, collectcode=FALSE}
/*
cd "C:/Users/my_username/Documents/new_project_folder/
*/
         ```

# Log files

After you have set the working directory, the next step is usually to open a `r colorize("log file", "YellowGreen")`. Log file is sort of built-in tape recorder where you can:

1. Retrieve the output of your work (except graphs)

2. Keep a record of your work

This will create the file `myfile.smcl` in your working directory: 

```{stata, results="hide"}
log using myfile, replace
```

By default, log files are recorded in a format called *Stata Markup and Control Language (SMCL)* and can be printed or converted to plain text. You can also specify `text` option if you want the log file to be in text format and read it in your word processor. 

Once you begin a log file, you can suspend it any time using the `log off` command and resume later with `log on`.

When you are done working on a project, type `log close` to stop logging and close the file.

# Examining the dataset

The `describe` command is an easy way to get acquainted with your dataset. It lists all the variables in the dataset, along with their types and variable labels.

```{stata, echo = c(3,4), message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
* Examining the dataset

sysuse auto, clear
describe
```

We can get a quick glimpse at the data by browsing it in the Data Editor or with the `browse` command:

![](src/browse.png)

From browsing, we see that the values for the **foreign** variable are blue. That means the values of the variable are `r colorize("labeled", "YellowGreen")`. Value labels are a helpful way to convey the meaning of logical or categorical variables. In the first row, **foreign** appears as `r colorize("Domestic", "Blue")`, but if we click the cell to view the underlying value, it's **0**.
	
There are several ways to reveal value labels:

```{stata, echo = c(3)}
* Ways to reveal value labels:
  
tabulate foreign
```

```{stata, echo=TRUE}
tabulate foreign, nolabel
```

```{stata, echo=TRUE}
label list
```

```{stata, echo = c(1)}
codebook foreign

* For information on how to create variable and value labels, see:
* help label
```

For information on how to create variable and value labels, see `help label`.

The `codebook` command is especially helpful if we want to know how many missing values a variable has. Another way to find out this is by using the `misstable` command:

```{stata, echo = c(3)}
* Exploring missing values

misstable summarize
```

The output table indicates that the **rep78** variable, which shows repair records, has *5* missing values. We can find out more about this variable using the `inspect` command.

```{stata, echo=TRUE}
inspect rep78
```

# Descriptive statistics

The `summarize` command gives a brief summary statistics about all the variables. In the output table, we can see the `r colorize("number of observations", "YellowGreen")`, `r colorize("mean", "YellowGreen")`, `r colorize("standard deviation", "YellowGreen")`, `r colorize("minimum", "YellowGreen")`, and `r colorize("maximum", "YellowGreen")` for each variable. 

```{stata, echo = c(3)}
* Descriptive statistics

summarize
```

To find out the `r colorize("median", "YellowGreen")`, we can use the `detail` option on the `summarize` command.

```{stata, echo=TRUE}
summarize trunk, detail
```

In this example, we can see that the `r colorize("median", "YellowGreen")` of the trunk space is *14 cu. ft.*

In *frequency tables*, we can see the `r colorize("mode", "YellowGreen")` of a variable by finding the largest `Freq.` or `Percent`. The `r colorize("mode", "YellowGreen")` is the trunk space is *16 cu. ft.*

```{stata, echo=TRUE}
tab trunk
```

><small> Stata commands can be abbreviated. For instance, instead of typing `tabulate`, we used `tab`.</small>

Frequency tables are especially useful when analyzing
categorical data.

```{stata, echo=TRUE}
tab foreign
```

* `Freq.` provides a raw count of each value. In this case, the dataset consists of 52 `r colorize("domestic", "Blue")` and 22 `r colorize("foreign", "Blue")` car models.

* `Percent` gives the relative frequency for each value. For
example, 29.73% of the car models in this dataset are `r colorize("foreign", "Blue")`.

* `Cum.` is the cumulative frequency in ascending order of
the values. For example, 70.27% of the car models in this dataset are `r colorize("domestic", "Blue")`.

If we want to quickly find out the differences in gas mileage across the cars’ origins, we can use the `summarize` option of the `tab` command: 

```{stata, echo=TRUE}
tabulate foreign, summarize(mpg)
```

This is a one-way table, so tabulate uses one variable. The variable being summarized is passed to the `tabulate` command with an option. Though we will not do it here, the `summarize`
option can also be used with two-way tables. 

# Creating new variables

To generate a new variable use the command `generate` (`gen` for short). The syntax for `generate` is

```{stata eval=FALSE, collectcode=FALSE}
generate [type] newvar[:lblname] = exp [if] [in] [, before(varname) | after(varname)]	
```

Each thing that you type after the command name is called an `r colorize("argument", "YellowGreen")`. Arguments in brackets are optional. Let's ignore the optional arguments for now and focus on the required syntax for `generate`:

```{stata eval=FALSE, collectcode=FALSE}
generate newvar = exp
```

`= exp` means an expression. An `r colorize("expression", "YellowGreen")` is simply the right-hand of an equation. Expressions can contain numbers, variable names, and more.
	
Let's try out the `generate` command:

1. A numeric variable calculated from another variable

```{stata echo = c(5),  results="hide"}
* Generate examples ----------------

* A numeric variable calculated from another variable

generate length_ft = length / 12

browse length length_ft
```

2. A numeric variable calculated from two other variables

```{stata echo = c(3),  results="hide"}
* A numeric variable calculated from two other variables

generate weight_per_length_ft = weight / length_ft
browse weight length_ft weight_per_length_ft
```

3. A logical variable is equal to **1** in rows where the expression is `true`, and **0** in rows where it is `false`

```{stata echo = c(4),  results="hide"}
* A logical variable is equal to 1 in rows where the expression is true, 
* and 0 in rows where it is false

generate headroom_3 = headroom == 3
browse headroom headroom_3
```

4. Logical variables can have many criteria

```{stata echo = c(3),  results="hide"}
* Logical variables can have many criteria.

generate ideal_car = price <= 4000 & mpg > 20 & make != "Chev. Nova"
browse price mpg make ideal_car
```

><small> In Stata syntax, an exclamation point means **not**. `!=` is an operator that means **not equal to**. `!` can also be used to negate an expression or part of an expression.</small>

The `generate` command above could also have been written as:

```{stata results="hide"}
gen ideal_car = price <= 4000 & mpg > 30 & !(make == "Chev. Nova")
```

Note, that, in Stata, missing values are infinitely large. 
Because of that, if `rep78` is missing, `rep78_gt_4` would be coded as **1** in the following example.

```{stata echo = c(1), results="hide"}
generate rep78_gt_4 = rep78 > 4
browse rep78 rep78_gt_4
```

Use the optional `if` argument, the `!` operator, and the `missing` operator to ensure that this does not happen. 

```{stata echo = c(1), results="hide"}
generate rep78_gt_4_nomiss = rep78 > 4 if !missing(rep78)
browse rep78 rep78_gt_4 rep78_gt_4_nomiss
```
